# JavaRTS
A barebones RTS based off of starcraft with lots of room for improvement

If you want to run the game (Requires Java 9) in its current state download the project somewhere and go into the
"JavaRTS\JavaRTS\out\artifacts\JavaRTS_jar" directory and run the jar, *making sure that the res folder and the jar are in the same directory* (Soon to be fixed! :D ).

If you find bugs please submit an issue as I dont always catch all of them
